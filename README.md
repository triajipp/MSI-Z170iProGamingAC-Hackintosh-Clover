## Installation
### Pre Installation
Download the official macOS Catalina image, [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) and [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool).

**DO NOT** use UniBeast to create the drive. It may create strange errors. And do not use MultiBeast for post installation jobs.

Follow [this guide](https://hackintosher.com/guides/how-to-make-a-macos-10-15-catalina-flash-drive-installer/) to create the boot drive. Copy my `/EFI` folder into the EFI partition of your boot drive. Also copy Clover Configurator and Hackintool into the main partition.

### During Installation 
Press F11 to boot into your flash drive. Move to **Boot macOS Install from Install macOS Catalina** and press spacebar to add -v(verbose) to display debug messages. If USB 3.0 gives error, switch to **USB 2.0**.

Before installation, first open **Disk Utility** to erase the drive. You can choose either APFS(recommended) or HFS+ with GUID partition map.

The system will auto reboot from USB for several times. In initialization page **DO NOT** connect to internet and login iCloud, Create a local account instead. Then you should be able to reach the desktop.

### Post Installation
After the first boot, open Clover Configurator to mount both EFI partitions in SSD and flash drive.

Copy everything from the EFI in flash drive to the EFI in SSD and reboot. Now you should be able to boot from SSD.

Refer to [this guide](https://hackintosher.com/forums/thread/generate-your-own-hackintosh-serial-number-board-serial-number-uuid-mlb-rom-in-clover.306) to generate serial number. Save and reboot. Then you should be able to login iCloud.

Enjoy your own Hackintosh!

1. If your iGPU is not HD 530, refer to [this guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-lilu-and-its-plug-ins.260063/#Headless) to recongnize the model correctly.
2. If you don't have a dGPU, i.e. output via iGPU, refer to [this guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/config.plist-per-hardware/skylake#properties) to modify `/EFI/CLOVER/config.plist`.
3. If your motherboard is not MSI Z170i Gaming Pro AC, refer to [this guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/the-new-beginners-guide-to-usb-port-configuration.286553) to create your own USB patch.

## Known issue
GPU fan spins at max RPM for several seconds during boot occasionally and runs normally in desktop. This might be a BIOS bug. You may choose any other Polaris GPUs.
